                        These are just a few of the driver-assist features that are arriving in new cars. As technology
                        races
                        ahead with the aim of making driving safer, drivers are left with the daunting task of figuring
                        out
                        how
                        it all works.
                    </p>

                    <p>Many dealerships offer car buyers a <a href="https://doi.org/10.3141%2F2660-02">brief
                            orientation</a>
                        to
                        these advanced driver-assist technologies. The glovebox manual, now thicker than ever, provides
                        many
                        of
                        the technical details. But as car technology continues to advance, scientists are making
                        important
                        discoveries about the human side of the equation, particularly what happens when drivers are
                        asked
                        to
                        perform familiar driving tasks in new ways. </p>

                    <p>This aspect of new cars is seldom discussed during orientations or covered in manuals. Here are
                        some
                        findings about using advanced driver-assist technologies that every driver should know. </p>

                    <h2>Staying alert</h2>

                    <p>A recent study that <a
                            href="https://aaafoundation.org/understanding-the-impact-of-technology-do-advanced-driver-assistance-and-semi-automated-vehicle-systems-lead-to-improper-driving-behavior/">observed
                            new car owners</a> during their first month of ownership found that drivers paid close
                        attention
                        as
                        they acquired a sense of what their driver-assist systems can and cannot do. But by the end of
                        the
                        month, many drivers began to allow their attention to drift from the road in uncomplicated
                        driving
                        situations - seemingly impossible-to-get-wrong scenarios such as open stretches of highway. </p>

                    <p>It may sound harmless enough, but here’s the catch: While an open stretch of road seems safe to a
                        human,
                        it can sometimes push the car’s computer vision system to its limits and beyond.</p>

                    <p>That’s why the federal government opened an <a
                            href="https://theconversation.com/why-the-feds-are-investigating-teslas-autopilot-and-what-that-means-for-the-future-of-self-driving-cars-166307">investigation
                            into Tesla’s Autopilot driver-assist technology</a> after 11 Teslas being operated on
                        Autopilot
                        smashed into police cars and firetrucks that had their emergency lights flashing.</p>

                    <p>Computers don’t see and understand the world as humans do. Sure, today’s artificial intelligence
                        systems
                        can beat the world’s greatest chess masters, but they can also miss a flashing firetruck that’s
                        sitting
                        right in front of them. We humans draw upon a powerful and flexible commonsense understanding of
                        the
                        world. Our <a
                            href="https://theconversation.com/an-ai-expert-explains-why-its-hard-to-give-computers-something-you-take-for-granted-common-sense-165600">cars
                            possess nothing like that</a>. They know the world as data compiled from video footage. </p>

                    <p>With that in mind, how do you know when to relax and when to be nervous while using a
                        driver-assist
                        system? The short answer is that you don’t.</p>

                    <p>The hazard detection systems in your new car are designed for those rarest of occasions in which
                        something eludes your watchful eye. But studies of drivers tell us that, after a time, many
                        begin to
                        rely on these systems as more than a backup. One recent study documented that <a
                            href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aap.2021.106348">drivers looked at the road less often</a>
                        and
                        focused their attention on non-driving areas more often while using Tesla’s Autopilot system.
                    </p>

                    <p>Without even realizing it, and slowly over time, simply knowing that a backup system exists can
                        coax
                        people into letting down their guard. In the most extreme cases, listening for an alarm to sound
                        can
                        become some people’s primary means of detecting a hazard. So instead of having two entities
                        watching
                        the
                        road, it’s down to one.</p>

                    <h2>Shared driving is hard work</h2>

                    <p>Maybe you are the type of driver who commits yourself to paying attention at all times, no matter
                        how
                        capable your car may seem. It turns out that watching a computer drive your car is harder than
                        it
                        looks.
                    </p>

                    <p>What seems like a leisurely activity at first can be <a

                    <p>To find out, researchers in another study outfitted drivers with brain and vision monitoring
                        systems
                        and
                        found that drivers who used the autopilot were <a

                            likely to drift into early stages of sleep</a> without ever realizing it. Today’s busy
                        schedules
                        can
                        cause a great many people to <a

                        People
                        tend to fight off that sleep debt by staying busy. But pushing a button and freeing yourself
                        from
                        the
                        activity of driving may give that lurking sleepiness an opportunity to catch up and overtake
                        you.

                    <h2>Literal and figurative blind spots</h2>

                    <p>Your new rearview camera seems like a lifesaver. It allows you to see into your worst blind spot.
                        But
                        a
                        study of drivers using these cameras found something unsettling. Having the cameras prompts many
                        drivers
                        to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aap.2015.11.030">skip the traditional over-the-shoulder
                            checks</a>. What these drivers generally don’t realize is that back-over crashes unfold over
                        time
                        and often begin to the side of a car. For example, kids can run out of a house and around the
                        back
                        of a
                        car to say goodbye to the driver. </p>

                    <p>When you swivel your head around to the back in addition to checking the camera, you see it all.
                        You
                        can
                        catch the beginning and the middle of these unfolding events, and then ensure a safe ending. But
                        among a
                        population of drivers who may not understand this, another study estimated that rearview cameras
                        only <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/15389588.2017.1317758">reduce back-over crashes by about
                            17%</a>
                        despite largely eliminating the rear blind spot.</p>

                    <h2>A new kind of driver training</h2>

                    <p>Driver assistance systems are powerful tools that promise to save a great many lives, but they
                        will
                        require people to adjust their understanding of a familiar driving task to align with one that
                        is
                        new
                        and different in important ways. The challenge is getting everyone to make that adjustment, and
                        there
                        are 250 million drivers in the U.S. alone. </p>

                    <p>My colleagues and I have pushed for <a
                            href="https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1555343419830901">standardized
                            training</a> for new car buyers that includes the <a
                            href="https://doi.org/10.1145/2830565">human
                            element of partially automated driving</a>. Part of the challenge is having to approach
                        drivers
                        with
                        some fairly counterintuitive ideas. </p>

                    <p>Imagine suggesting to someone that they don’t understand the difference between a safe situation
                        and
                        a
                        dangerous one, or that they really don’t know when they are tired, or that watching a car drive
                        itself
                        is more tiring than driving. For many drivers, this advice might not sink in when they first use
                        driver-assist technologies. It may take some profound and personal reconsideration of what you
                        think
                        you
                        know.</p>

                    <p>And what about the youngest drivers, the ones who account for a <a
                            href="https://aaafoundation.org/rates-motor-vehicle-crashes-injuries-deaths-relation-driver-age-united-states-2014-2015/">disproportionate
                            number of crashes</a>? More than a decade after <a
                            href="https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/High-schools-curb-driver-s-ed-as-interest-dies-3287757.php">driver
                            education was virtually eliminated</a> from high school curricula, along came smartphones,
                        apps
                        and
                        now driver-assist technologies. It might be a good time to start teaching some new safety
                        concepts,
                        in
                        the classroom if not behind the wheel of a car. </p>

                    <p>For now, after you’ve learned to push the buttons and interpret the displays in your new car,
                        keep in
                        mind that there is more to using these technologies than meets the eye.</p>
