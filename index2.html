                These are just a few of the driver-assist features that are arriving in new cars. As technology races
                ahead with the aim of making driving safer, drivers are left with the daunting task of figuring out how
                it all works. </p>

            <p>Many dealerships offer car buyers a <a href="https://doi.org/10.3141%2F2660-02">brief orientation</a> to
                these advanced driver-assist technologies. The glovebox manual, now thicker than ever, provides many of
                the technical details. But as car technology continues to advance, scientists are making important
                discoveries about the human side of the equation, particularly what happens when drivers are asked to
                perform familiar driving tasks in new ways. </p>

            <p>This aspect of new cars is seldom discussed during orientations or covered in manuals. Here are some
                findings about using advanced driver-assist technologies that every driver should know. </p>

            <h2>Staying alert</h2>

            <p>A recent study that <a
                    href="https://aaafoundation.org/understanding-the-impact-of-technology-do-advanced-driver-assistance-and-semi-automated-vehicle-systems-lead-to-improper-driving-behavior/">observed
                    new car owners</a> during their first month of ownership found that drivers paid close attention as
                they acquired a sense of what their driver-assist systems can and cannot do. But by the end of the
                month, many drivers began to allow their attention to drift from the road in uncomplicated driving
                situations - seemingly impossible-to-get-wrong scenarios such as open stretches of highway. </p>

            <p>It may sound harmless enough, but here’s the catch: While an open stretch of road seems safe to a human,
                it can sometimes push the car’s computer vision system to its limits and beyond.</p>

            <p>That’s why the federal government opened an <a
                    href="https://theconversation.com/why-the-feds-are-investigating-teslas-autopilot-and-what-that-means-for-the-future-of-self-driving-cars-166307">investigation
                    into Tesla’s Autopilot driver-assist technology</a> after 11 Teslas being operated on Autopilot
                smashed into police cars and firetrucks that had their emergency lights flashing.</p>

            <p>Computers don’t see and understand the world as humans do. Sure, today’s artificial intelligence systems
                can beat the world’s greatest chess masters, but they can also miss a flashing firetruck that’s sitting
                right in front of them. We humans draw upon a powerful and flexible commonsense understanding of the
                world. Our <a
                    href="https://theconversation.com/an-ai-expert-explains-why-its-hard-to-give-computers-something-you-take-for-granted-common-sense-165600">cars
                    possess nothing like that</a>. They know the world as data compiled from video footage. </p>

            <p>With that in mind, how do you know when to relax and when to be nervous while using a driver-assist
                system? The short answer is that you don’t.</p>

            <p>The hazard detection systems in your new car are designed for those rarest of occasions in which
                something eludes your watchful eye. But studies of drivers tell us that, after a time, many begin to
                rely on these systems as more than a backup. One recent study documented that <a
                    href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aap.2021.106348">drivers looked at the road less often</a> and
                focused their attention on non-driving areas more often while using Tesla’s Autopilot system. </p>

            <p>Without even realizing it, and slowly over time, simply knowing that a backup system exists can coax
                people into letting down their guard. In the most extreme cases, listening for an alarm to sound can
                become some people’s primary means of detecting a hazard. So instead of having two entities watching the
                road, it’s down to one.</p>

            <h2>Shared driving is hard work</h2>

            <p>Maybe you are the type of driver who commits yourself to paying attention at all times, no matter how
                capable your car may seem. It turns out that watching a computer drive your car is harder than it looks.
            </p>

            <p>What seems like a leisurely activity at first can be <a
                    href="https://doi.org/10.1518%2F001872008X312152">oddly tiring</a>. It’s hard to <a
                    href="https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0018720813495280">keep your mind focused</a> on what’s happening in
                front of you - especially <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aap.2013.04.003">along familiar routes</a>
                and when all is going as expected. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080%2F17470214808416738">Prolonged
                    sitting and staring</a>, waiting for improbable disaster to strike, is not something that humans are
                naturally good at. </p>

            <p>It’s hard to imagine ever pushing an autopilot button and taking a nap like those drivers you’ve <a
                    href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/tesla-driver-caught-on-camera-apparently-asleep-at-the-wheel-68543557694">seen
                    on the evening news</a>, but here is where misunderstanding strikes again. Did these drivers plan to
                take a nap or did it just happen? </p>

            <p>To find out, researchers in another study outfitted drivers with brain and vision monitoring systems and
                found that drivers who used the autopilot were <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsz067.192">more
                    likely to drift into early stages of sleep</a> without ever realizing it. Today’s busy schedules can
                cause a great many people to <a
                    href="https://sleepeducation.org/cdc-americans-sleep-deprived/">accumulate sleep debt</a>. People
                tend to fight off that sleep debt by staying busy. But pushing a button and freeing yourself from the
                activity of driving may give that lurking sleepiness an opportunity to catch up and overtake you. </p>

            <h2>Literal and figurative blind spots</h2>

            <p>Your new rearview camera seems like a lifesaver. It allows you to see into your worst blind spot. But a
                study of drivers using these cameras found something unsettling. Having the cameras prompts many drivers
                to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aap.2015.11.030">skip the traditional over-the-shoulder
                    checks</a>. What these drivers generally don’t realize is that back-over crashes unfold over time
                and often begin to the side of a car. For example, kids can run out of a house and around the back of a
                car to say goodbye to the driver. </p>

            <p>When you swivel your head around to the back in addition to checking the camera, you see it all. You can
                catch the beginning and the middle of these unfolding events, and then ensure a safe ending. But among a
                population of drivers who may not understand this, another study estimated that rearview cameras only <a
                    href="https://doi.org/10.1080/15389588.2017.1317758">reduce back-over crashes by about 17%</a>
                despite largely eliminating the rear blind spot.</p>

            <h2>A new kind of driver training</h2>

            <p>Driver assistance systems are powerful tools that promise to save a great many lives, but they will
                require people to adjust their understanding of a familiar driving task to align with one that is new
                and different in important ways. The challenge is getting everyone to make that adjustment, and there
                are 250 million drivers in the U.S. alone. </p>

            <p>My colleagues and I have pushed for <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1555343419830901">standardized
                    training</a> for new car buyers that includes the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/2830565">human
                    element of partially automated driving</a>. Part of the challenge is having to approach drivers with
                some fairly counterintuitive ideas. </p>

            <p>Imagine suggesting to someone that they don’t understand the difference between a safe situation and a
                dangerous one, or that they really don’t know when they are tired, or that watching a car drive itself
                is more tiring than driving. For many drivers, this advice might not sink in when they first use
                driver-assist technologies. It may take some profound and personal reconsideration of what you think you
                know.</p>

            <p>And what about the youngest drivers, the ones who account for a <a
                    href="https://aaafoundation.org/rates-motor-vehicle-crashes-injuries-deaths-relation-driver-age-united-states-2014-2015/">disproportionate
                    number of crashes</a>? More than a decade after <a
                    href="https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/High-schools-curb-driver-s-ed-as-interest-dies-3287757.php">driver
                    education was virtually eliminated</a> from high school curricula, along came smartphones, apps and
                now driver-assist technologies. It might be a good time to start teaching some new safety concepts, in
                the classroom if not behind the wheel of a car. </p>

            <p>For now, after you’ve learned to push the buttons and interpret the displays in your new car, keep in
                mind that there is more to using these technologies than meets the eye.</p>
